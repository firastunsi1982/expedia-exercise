Expedia-Exercise
================

-This application was built in a PHP language, I have chosen PHP language because I am familiar with it and most of my experience in this language.
-The purpose of this application to retrieve the hotel offers from Expedia Json data and filter on these hotels.
-I was think to build this application using any PHP frameworks like Laravel or Codeigniter but the exercise is small and no need to add more libraries i will not use it, So i just did it a simple implementation and clear.
-I tried to figure out some more parameters to add it on my API Search like hotelName and almostSoldStatus but it didn't work i don't know what is the correct parameters name that Expedia use.
